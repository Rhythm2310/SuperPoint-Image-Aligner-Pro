# SuperPoint Image Aligner Pro

**SuperPoint Image Aligner Pro** is a professional-grade image alignment tool designed for aligning multiple images with a reference image using advanced feature detection and matching techniques. Built on top of the **SuperPoint** model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library, this tool offers:

- **Scenario presets**: Predefined parameter configurations for different use cases (e.g., low-texture images, satellite imagery, medical images).
- **Multi-pass alignment**: Iterative refinement for improved accuracy.
- **Detailed parameter documentation**: Comprehensive tooltips and descriptions for fine-tuning.
- **Advanced tuning controls**: Customize keypoint detection, feature matching, and geometric validation parameters.
- **Auto AI**: Automatic parameter optimization based on image characteristics.

## Features

1. **SuperPoint Feature Detection**:
   - Extracts keypoints and descriptors using the SuperPoint model.
   - Filters keypoints based on confidence scores and maximum keypoint limits.

2. **Auto AI Parameter Optimization**:
   - Analyzes image characteristics such as texture, brightness, and contrast.
   - Dynamically adjusts alignment parameters for optimal results.

3. **Multi-Pass Alignment Pipeline**:
   - Supports up to 5 alignment passes for iterative refinement.
   - Uses FLANN-based feature matching and RANSAC for robust homography estimation.

4. **Professional GUI**:
   - Built with PyQt6 for an intuitive user interface.
   - Includes input configuration, advanced tuning parameters, and real-time logging.

5. **Scenario Presets**:
   - Predefined settings for various scenarios:
     - General Purpose
     - Low-texture Images
     - Fast Processing
     - High Precision
     - Satellite Imagery
     - Medical Images

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, for faster inference)

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch transformers opencv-python pillow PyQt6
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SuperPoint-Image-Aligner-Pro.git
cd SuperPoint-Image-Aligner-Pro
```

## Usage

### Running the GUI

To launch the graphical user interface:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Input Configuration

1. **Reference Image**: Select the reference image to which other images will be aligned.
2. **Target Images**: Select one or more target images for alignment.
3. **Output Directory**: Choose the directory where aligned images will be saved.

### Advanced Tuning Parameters

The GUI provides sliders and input fields for adjusting key parameters, including:
- **Minimum Matches**: Minimum number of geometrically consistent matches required.
- **Ratio Threshold**: Lowe's ratio test threshold for feature matching.
- **FLANN Parameters**: Number of index trees and search checks.
- **Geometric Validation**: USAC reprojection error threshold and minimum inlier ratio.
- **Feature Control**: Maximum keypoints and match distance threshold.

### Auto AI

Enable the "Auto AI" checkbox to automatically analyze each image and optimize alignment parameters based on its characteristics.

### Logging

The processing log displays real-time updates, including:
- Detected keypoints and matches.
- Homography estimation results.
- Saved output paths.

## In-Depth Calculation Explanations

### Feature Extraction

The SuperPoint model extracts keypoints and descriptors from images. The keypoints are filtered based on their confidence scores. If the number of keypoints exceeds the specified maximum (`max_keypoints`), only the top-scoring keypoints are retained.

$$
\text{Filtered Keypoints} = \text{Keypoints}[\text{argsort(Scores)}[-\text{max\_keypoints}:]]
$$

### Auto AI: Image Analysis

The `analyze_image` function evaluates image characteristics such as texture, brightness, and contrast to suggest optimal parameters. Texture sharpness is measured using the variance of the Laplacian:

$$
\text{Laplacian Variance} = \text{Var}(\nabla^2 I)
$$

Brightness and contrast are calculated as:

$$
\text{Mean Intensity} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i
$$
$$
\text{Contrast} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (I_i - \text{Mean Intensity})^2}
$$

Based on these metrics, the function adjusts parameters like `min_matches`, `ratio_threshold`, and `flann_checks`.

### Feature Matching

The FLANN-based matcher uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to find the best matches between descriptors. Lowe's ratio test ensures that only high-quality matches are retained:

$$
m.distance < \text{ratio\_threshold} \times n.distance
$$

Additionally, an absolute distance threshold is applied:

$$
m.distance < \text{match\_distance\_thresh}
$$

### Homography Estimation

The homography matrix $ H $ is estimated using RANSAC with the USAC algorithm. The reprojection error threshold ($ \epsilon $) determines the maximum allowable error for inliers:

$$
\text{Reprojection Error} = \| \mathbf{x}' - H \mathbf{x} \|
$$

where $ \mathbf{x} $ and $ \mathbf{x}' $ are corresponding points in the source and destination images.

The inlier ratio is calculated as:

$$
\text{Inlier Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of Inliers}}{\text{Total Matches}}
$$

Only alignments with an inlier ratio greater than `min_inlier_ratio` are accepted.

## Code Structure

- **Model Initialization**: Loads the SuperPoint model and sets up the device (CPU/GPU).
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts and filters keypoints and descriptors using SuperPoint.
- **Alignment Logic**: Implements multi-pass alignment with FLANN-based matching and RANSAC.
- **Worker Thread**: Handles alignment in a separate thread to prevent GUI freezing.
- **GUI**: Built with PyQt6 for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
